## API Python

> API stands for Application Programming Interface.
> RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

An API end point is a URL which can help to retrieve, create, update or delete a resource.
Example: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/lists/members.json.

Reports:
- For some reason doesn't display in json format.
- No effect after implemented `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` flask methods (Do i need form templates to do that? might try that again later).
